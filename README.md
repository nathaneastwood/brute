## Overview

The goal of `brute` is to print the string "Hello, World".

## Installation

You can install the package directly from GitHub using the [`devtools` package](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools).

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
install_github("nathaneastwood/brute")
```

## Useage

The package only offers one function: `brute()`.

## Inspiration

I was inspired to write this package by [r/ProgrammerHumor](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/8fdyf0/i_heard_were_brute_forcing_hello_world_now/). Because what else am I going to do on a Saturday morning?
